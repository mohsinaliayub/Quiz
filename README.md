A multiplayer quiz app. Play with your friends!

The app is built while following the [Professional iOS Engineering](https://www.essentialdeveloper.com/articles/professional-ios-engineering-youtube-series) series by [Essential Developer](https://iosacademy.essentialdeveloper.com/).

## Learning Outcomes
While following this series, I will learn and practice:
  - The discipline of test-driven development (TDD)
  - The power of modular systems, and
  - How to welcome future requirements

Apart from the learning outcomes listed above, I will learn how to maintain a sustainable development cycle and 
continuously reflect on how to become more effective while paying attention to technical excellence and good design.

## Series Description
The series has been divided into three seasons. I will log my learning progress and list the episodes I have finished here.

It will be a quick reminder on what I have achieved and how to implement it in my own apps.
